TO DO:
- checkout strategy
- merging strategies
- <BUG> Check all usage of ':' character splitting
        - for example in commit message ':' character breaks command
        - either do not allow for ':' char to be used or find other split/way to store data
- client server someday
- data doesn't get hashed right!
