TO DO:

---- TOP PRIO ----
 
- encrypt data in objects

- checkout strategy test more


- <BUG> Check all usage of ':' character splitting
        - for example in commit message ':' character breaks command
        - either do not allow for ':' char to be used or find other split/way to store data
        - PLAN FOR THIS ---> replace with '?', seems like git itself doesn't allow it, in pr names at least!!!
        - if they appear remove them, no one will ever know :D

- merging strategies
- format file names when adding...


---- LOW TO NO PRIO? ----
- client server
